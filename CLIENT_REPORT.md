## üî¨ **Technical Solution**

### **Machine Learning Approach**
We implemented a **Multi-Output Random Forest Regression** model that simultaneously predicts four nutrition targets:

1. **Daily Calories** (energy requirements)
2. **Protein** (muscle maintenance and growth)
3. **Carbohydrates** (energy and brain function)
4. **Fats** (hormone production and vitamin absorption)

### **Advanced Features**
#### **1. Intelligent Feature Engineering**
- **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**: Individual metabolism calculation using Mifflin-St Jeor equation
- **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**: Activity-adjusted calorie burn
- **Health Risk Score**: Composite assessment of medical risk factors (0-100 scale)
- **Activity Profiling**: Exercise frequency and daily steps integration

#### **2. Safety Validation System**
- **Calorie bounds**: 80-200% of BMR to prevent dangerous recommendations
- **Protein limits**: 0.8-2.5g per kg body weight (medical guidelines)
- **Macro validation**: Ensures realistic nutrient distribution
- **Health-based adjustments**: Special handling for high-risk users

#### **3. Meal Planning Intelligence**
- **Scientific meal distribution**: 25% breakfast, 35% lunch, 30% dinner, 10% snacks
- **Food database integration**: Real food suggestions matched to nutrition targets
- **Customization guidance**: Portion adjustments and food substitutions
